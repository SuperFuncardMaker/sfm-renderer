# sfm-renderer
This library is a part of [Super Funcard Maker](https://github.com/SuperFuncardMaker/).
This is the core image renderer.

Main contributor : Lancel Thaledric (thaledric@gmail.com)

## Dependencies

This library is written in Javascript. You need a Javascript runtime like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to use it.

The renderer uses [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) as its graphical library. You DO need to have it installed in the running environment.
NOTE : The sfm-renderer is used only for the server-side and command-line. The front-end doesn't need it, nor ImageMagick.
